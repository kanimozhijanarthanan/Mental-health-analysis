# Mental Health Analysis

This repository contains a mini project on **Mental Health Analysis** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The aim is to classify mental health-related text data and provide actionable insights.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on analyzing text data related to mental health, providing valuable insights through machine learning models. Various preprocessing techniques and algorithms have been employed to achieve effective text classification.

### Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the text data for analysis.
- Machine Learning Models: Built several models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Random Forest** for classification.
- Model Evaluation: Performance metrics like **ROC Curve** and **AUC Score** were used to evaluate the models.
- Visualization: Used visualizations such as **ROC Curve** to showcase model performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk`

You can install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook file (`Mental Health Analysis.ipynb`).
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, preprocess it, and run machine learning models.
4. Visualize the results using the included plots.

### Model Workflow
1. **Data Loading:** Load mental health-related text data.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data using NLP techniques (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.).
3. **Model Building:** Train models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like **ROC AUC**.
5. **Visualization:** Plot ROC curves to visualize the performance.

### ROC Curve Example
Below is an example of an ROC curve generated by a Random Forest model:
